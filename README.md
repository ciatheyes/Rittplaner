# Rittplaner

A student project created as an exercise at ETH Zurich in 2018.

A live version of the web map is available via GitHub Pages at https://ciatheyes.github.io/Rittplaner/. Unfortunately, Google Maps is no longer free. Thus, the live web map shows the satellite imagery with the darkened satellite images and an overlaid disclaimer. For the same reason, the routing functionality no longer works either.

Some minor updates were added in 2024 to make it fit for publishing on GitHub Pages.
